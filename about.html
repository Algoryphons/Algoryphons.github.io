          We are a team of enthusiastic Year 12 students from The Gryphon School in Sherborne, Dorset, proudly stepping into the world of robotics through our first year participating in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC).
          <br><br>
          Although this is our debut season, we are approaching the challenge with determination, curiosity, and a strong team spirit. As newcomers, we understand the steep learning curve ahead - but we’re not here to be underestimated. We’re ready to face every obstacle head-on, learn quickly, and compete with resilience and creativity as well as learning to Overcome and Adapt in the challenges ahead. 
          <br><br>
          For some of us, this may be our only season due to the academic demands of Year 13, but we are committed to making the most of every moment. We may not be here for a long time, but we’re here to make it count - and to have an unforgettable experience along the way. But that doesn't mean we can't support the new members that we bring along next season to take our place and to embrace the Algoryphon spirit. So without further ado, let the excitement and games commence!

              Welcome To FTC
            </div>
            <p>
              The journey of The Algoryphons began with a spark of curiosity and a shared passion for innovation. At the time, none of us had heard of the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) - an international robotics competition that champions STEM education and collaborative problem-solving. When Mr. Miles, our dedicated computer science teacher, introduced us to the program, we were immediately inspired by the opportunity to engage in a global initiative that blends technology, creativity, and teamwork.
              
              <br><br>
              Recognising the potential of this challenge, we set out to form a team that could rise to the occasion. What started as a small group of computer science students quickly grew through word of mouth, as like-minded peers joined us, each bringing unique skills and perspectives. Together, we founded The Algoryphons - a name that reflects both our technical roots and our imaginative spirit.
              
              <br><br>
              From the outset, we knew this would be more than just a competition. It would be a journey of growth, resilience, and discovery. With a shared commitment to Overcome and Adapt to every challenge, we began laying the foundations of a team ready to take on the world of robotics in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC).
            </p>


            <br><br>
            <div id="our_journey_txt_header">
              Initial Ideas
            </div>
            <p>
              As the competition began, we quickly realised the importance of making our presence known - to show that a small rural school made up entirely of first-year students has the capability and determination to take on such a monumental challenge.
              
              <br><br>
              So, where did we begin?
              
              <br><br>
              Our journey started with an introduction to the competition by Mr Miles, whose enthusiasm for the event was infectious. His passion inspired us to fully commit to the challenge - striving not only to have fun but also to uphold the core values of gracious professionalism and cooperation. But before we could take our first steps, we needed an identity - a name that captured our team’s essence.
              
              <br><br>
              During our first official session, we brainstormed various potential names, including "The Sherbots" and "Enigma Sigmas." While creative, these didn’t quite capture who we were. Eventually, we landed on The Algoryphons - a fusion of “algorithm” and our school name, The Gryphon School. The name represents our technical aspirations and our origin. With that, The Algoryphons were founded - ready to Overcome and Adapt to any challenge, and eager to demonstrate our team spirit and enthusiasm throughout the competition.
              
              <br><br>
              However, a strong name alone wouldn't be enough. We needed leadership to provide direction, organise tasks, and ensure we stayed focused under pressure. An internal election was held, with three candidates - Harry, Xiang Yao, and Fynn - each bringing unique strengths and inspiring ideas to the table. After thoughtful interviews and team voting, Fynn was elected as team captain. His confidence and energy, paired with a clear plan for engaging team activities, made him the ideal leader to guide us through the season.
              
              <br><br>
              With leadership in place, the team divided into three focused departments, each with their own goals and responsibilities:
              
              <br>
              Engineering, led by Rupesh, whose prior hands-on experience and technical knowledge made him a natural choice.
              
              <br>
              Programming, led by Harry, whose resilience and depth of coding experience made him the best fit for the role.
              
              <br>
              Marketing, led by Rhys, who demonstrated strong leadership, creativity, and a passion for communication—crucial for building our public image.
              
              <br><br>
              With a strong foundation and clear leadership, The Algoryphons officially embarked on our FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) expedition.
              
              <br><br>
              Each department played a critical role in our development and success.

              Week 1 (2/10/2024)<br>
              During our first official session, Mr Miles introduced us to the competition with great enthusiasm, detailing everything about the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) and how beneficial it can be for us, inspiring us to approach the challenge with both energy and professionalism. We focused on establishing our team identity, brainstorming various names such as "The Sherbots" and "Enigma Sigmas." Ultimately, we chose The Algoryphons - a combination of “algorithm” and The Gryphon School - a name that reflects both our technical focus and our roots. This marked the beginning of our journey, united under a shared vision to Overcome and Adapt.

            <p>
              Week 2 (9/10/2024)<br>
              While establishing a team identity was a crucial first step, effective leadership was essential to ensure coordination, task management, and sustained focus throughout the competition. In our second official session, we held an internal election with three strong candidates - Harry, Xiang Yao, and Fynn - each offering distinct skills and compelling visions for the team. Following a structured process of interviews and team-wide voting, Fynn was chosen as team captain. His confident leadership style, coupled with a clear strategy for fostering engagement and collaboration, positioned him well to lead the team through the challenges ahead.

              Week 3 (16/10/2025)<br>
              During this session, the Engineering team began conceptualising initial designs for the robot while awaiting the arrival of key components. Lead Engineer Rupesh took the initiative to create detailed sketches and notes in his notebook, documenting potential design ideas for future reference. These sketches were intended not only to guide the engineering process but also to help all team members - regardless of their department - gain a clearer understanding of the robot's design and functionality. Below is a collection of the notes and design concepts developed during this stage.

              Week 4 (23/10/2024)<br>
              In this session, the long-awaited robot components finally arrived, enabling the Engineering team to physically examine and familiarise themselves with the parts prior to assembly. This hands-on interaction provided valuable insight into the materials and mechanisms they would be working with. The initial plan was to construct the standard starter robot, which would serve as a foundation for ongoing development. Over time, the team aims to iteratively refine and adapt the robot to better align with our specific goals and competition requirements.

              Week 1 (6/11/2024)<br>
              Following the half-term break, the Engineering team focused on organising the newly arrived components into clearly labelled containers. This system not only minimised the risk of losing parts but also significantly improved efficiency by making it easier to locate specific items during the build process. While part of the team managed the organisation, Lead Engineer Rupesh began studying the construction guidelines for the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) starter robot. This allowed him to develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the assembly process, laying the groundwork for an effective and informed build.

              Week 1 (8/1/2025)<br>
              Following the return from the holidays, the team promptly resumed work with renewed focus. The first item on the agenda was a collaborative mind-mapping session aimed at generating innovative ideas to enhance the robot’s performance. Leading Engineer Rupesh facilitated the discussion, guiding the team through strategies to evolve the FTC starter robot into a more agile and competitive design. After thorough deliberation, the Engineering team agreed to dismantle the starter robot, repurposing its components to construct a more efficient and performance-oriented model. Additionally, the team revisited a pre-holiday proposal to incorporate Mecanum wheels and vertical motion slides. Inspired by the capabilities observed in other teams’ robots, they concluded that these enhancements would significantly improve manoeuvrability across the arena and enable the robot to reach elevated rungs with greater ease.

              Week 1 (5/3/2025)<br>
              This week, the team was energized and full of innovative ideas following last week’s workshop with Eaton. With guidance from the Eaton representatives, the Mecanum drivetrain was successfully completed and underwent its first round of testing as the team took the robot for a trial run around the school grounds. Building on this momentum, the Engineering team has now shifted focus to constructing the linear slide mechanism. This critical component will enable the robot to achieve vertical extension, allowing it to reach elevated rungs and maximize scoring potential during competition.

              During this session, the Engineering team focused on advancing the construction of the linear slide mechanism for our new robot design. Although this component will require significant time and precision to complete, it is essential for the robot’s ability to perform effectively in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC). Engineers Lukas and Adonis collaborated with Rupesh to assemble the slide system, which will provide the vertical extension necessary to reach elevated rungs during the competition. In parallel with this task, the team also worked on finalising the Mecanum drivetrain - resolving wiring interferences and adjusting the servos to optimize the robot’s mobility and overall performance.

              Week 3 (19/3/2025)<br>
              At the start of this session, the Engineering team resumed work on constructing the linear slide mechanism, a key component of our robot’s vertical reach. Meanwhile, the rest of the team brought the Mecanum drivetrain to the school’s dance studio, utilising the large open space to test the robot’s manoeuvrability in a setting that closely simulates the competition environment. Using this space, the team mapped out the dimensions of the official FTC arena in preparation for the upcoming Qualifiers held at Bournemouth University. During this time, our lead driver, Josh W, had his first opportunity to operate the robot in a practical setting. He successfully navigated the robot through various obstacles with precision and confidence - affirming his capability as our primary driver for competition. Having a full-scale mock-up of the arena provided the team with valuable insight into the spatial layout we will encounter. This perspective will help inform strategic planning for optimal specimen retrieval and guide our software engineers in developing and refining the robot’s autonomous routines.

              Following the successful test runs with the drivetrain and the collection of critical data regarding the arena’s dimensions, the team reconvened with Engineering Lead Rupesh to report key findings and suggest improvements to the Mecanum drivetrain. One significant observation was that the wheels spun at a rate that propelled the robot at excessive speeds. While speed can be advantageous, it also poses risks - such as reduced control, potential collisions with arena walls, or even unintended contact with other teams’ robots, which could lead to damage. Another issue identified was that some of the wiring became loose during operation, hindering the robot's movement and reliability. To address this, the team proposed securing the wires more effectively in future builds using zip ties to ensure stability and prevent disconnections. While these assessments were being communicated to Rupesh, engineers Lukas and Adonis remained focused on the continued construction of the linear slide mechanism, ensuring steady progress on this vital component.

              Week 1 (2/4/2025)<br>
              With the Easter holidays fast approaching, it was all hands on deck to get the robot fully assembled. This included attaching the linear slide mechanism and intake system to the Mecanum drivetrain, as well as completing all wiring and modifications for peak performance. However, time was running out quickly. Both the engineering and programming teams worked closely together to bring the robot to full functionality, but the mounting pressure was beginning to take its toll. No matter what the team had to Overcome and Adapt to this issue. To address this, a plan was devised to give the team more time for assembly and refinement. The robot would be transported from the Algoryphon HQ (Innovation Hub) to Rupesh’s house, where further modifications could continue outside of regular working hours. The entire team assisted in moving the robot - along with all the essential parts - to Rupesh’s home, with the hope that he would be able to complete the necessary updates in time.

              Rupesh's Home Build (3/4/2025)<br>
              With the robot now in his care, Rupesh took on the challenge of completing its long-overdue construction. His primary tasks included attaching the linear slide mechanism, enabling vertical extension so the robot could reach high rungs, and installing the front-facing intake system designed to collect field specimens. Additionally, a newly designed claw mechanism needed to be integrated with the vertical slide, allowing the robot to lift and secure samples onto elevated targets.

              The scope of the task was daunting, but Rupesh faced it with determination, being able to Overcome and Adapt to this hurdle. Despite the complexity and pressure, he successfully assembled the remaining components, including the necessary wiring - though some of it remained untidy and scheduled for refinement at a later stage. Working tirelessly through the night and into the following day, Rupesh demonstrated exceptional commitment and resilience. The team deeply appreciates his dedication and is more grateful than ever to have such a dependable and capable Engineering lead.
           
              However, a new challenge quickly emerged. While the robot was now mechanically complete, none of the newly added features had been programmed. To address this, another plan was put into motion: the robot would be transported to Tom’s house. Tom generously volunteered to host the robot and take on the responsibility of programming each component with precision. The rest of the team would later regroup at Tom’s house to assist with final integration and to document the final stages of this critical phase - scheduled to continue over the course of the Easter holidays.

            <p>
              Week 3, Easter Holidays (16/4/2025)<br>
              This week, four dedicated team members arrived bright and early at Tom’s house, ready to push our robot closer to completion. The group consisted of Rupesh, Lukas, Amber, and Rhys, each bringing their unique skills and energy to the task at hand. Rupesh and Lukas, our engineering leads, focused on refining the mechanical aspects of the robot - particularly the servos and movement systems - to ensure smooth and precise operation. Working alongside them were Tom and Amber from the programming team, who were responsible for finalising the robot’s code, debugging issues, and integrating the newly added features into a cohesive system. Meanwhile, Rhys from marketing contributed by boosting morale, supplying snacks, and documenting the team’s journey. He was also responsible for meticulously compiling the team portfolio, with additional support from Xiang-Yao via video call. This five-hour working session demonstrated the team’s resilience and unity as we tested and refined our machine’s capabilities.
              
              During testing, we encountered several technical issues. The vertical slide mechanism, at times, extended beyond its intended limits, causing structural failures and cable snapping. Fortunately, the team had anticipated potential problems and brought spare cabling, which allowed for quick replacements. To address the issue permanently, the programming team methodically tested and calibrated the vertical slide range to determine the optimal maximum extension - ensuring reliability without risking hardware damage.
              
              Of course, all this effort worked up an appetite. The team paused for a well-deserved lunch - pizza, which was quickly devoured—before returning to work with renewed focus and energy. The final touches were made to the robot's assembly, marking significant progress in both hardware and software integration.
              
              As the session neared its end, a new discussion emerged: choosing a name for our robot. Led by Rhys and Xiang-Yao, the team sought a name that would align with this year’s FIRST Tech Challenge theme, "Into the Deep," and also reflect the robot’s function and design. After thoughtful deliberation, the name Triton was selected - drawing inspiration from the son of Poseidon and god of the sea. To further encapsulate the robot’s purpose, an acronym was created: T.R.I.T.O.N., standing for Tactical Retrieval and Intelligent Transport-Oriented Navigator. The name perfectly captured the robot’s mission and capabilities.
              
              This session concluded with a sense of accomplishment and shared enthusiasm. Despite facing several technical hurdles, the team Overcame and Adapted to each one with persistence and teamwork - making it one of the most successful and memorable moments of our build season so far.

            <p>
              Session 1 (22/4/2025)<br>
              This session marked the beginning of what may be our final week working on T.R.I.T.O.N. - and possibly our final days as part of the Algoryphon team. However, this realisation didn’t dampen our spirits. On the contrary, it motivated us to work even harder, knowing that we wanted to end this journey on a high note. We may not be here for a long time, but we are determined to make it a meaningful and memorable time. The team began by reviewing and approving the final design of the robot, expressing pride in how far it had come. For the first time, our designated drivers - Josh W. and Aaron - had the opportunity to operate the fully assembled robot. Josh, serving as the primary driver, focused on manoeuvrability and navigation, while Aaron managed the intake system and vertical extension mechanism. This session served as valuable practice, allowing the duo to develop strong communication and coordination skills - essential for effective performance during competition. Their teamwork demonstrated promising potential as they learned to synchronise their actions to score efficiently and respond dynamically within the arena.
            </p>

            <p>
              Session 2 (23/4/2025)<br>
              During the second of our final three sessions this week, Josh W. and Aaron returned to their roles, continuing to refine their skills and strengthen their coordination as the robot’s driver and operator. Their teamwork steadily improved as they focused on effective communication and precise control - an essential combination for competition success. While practice was underway, team leaders Rhys, Rupesh, and Harry began planning our presentation for the upcoming FIRST Tech Challenge Qualifiers. The proposed structure centred around having our team captain, Fynn, lead the presentation, offering a cohesive introduction before handing over to the sub-team leads. Engineering would begin by outlining the design and construction process, providing insights into the challenges and innovations behind T.R.I.T.O.N.’s development. They would be followed by the Software Engineering team, who would explain their programming strategies and how the robot’s logic was brought to life. Finally, the Marketing team would conclude the presentation by sharing the story of our team’s formation, outreach efforts, and accomplishments throughout the season. With a clear plan in place and energy high, the team felt confident and prepared to take on the FTC Qualifiers with both gracious professionalism and pride.
            </p>

            <p>
              Session 3 (24/4/2025)<br>
              As our final session came to a close, the team took a step back to reflect on the journey we've shared - looking back at our humble beginnings and appreciating just how far we've come. Revisiting our challenges and achievements filled us with pride, not only for what we've accomplished, but for how we've grown through adversity.
              
              Throughout the season, we’ve embraced the philosophy of Overcome and Adapt - a mindset forged through countless setbacks, unexpected issues and malfunctions, and tough deadlines. Despite these obstacles, we consistently found ways to move forward, learning to thrive under pressure and supporting one another every step of the way. This ability to unite in the face of difficulty is what defines us - not just as individuals with roles, but as a true team.
              
              More than that, it's the unwavering collaboration across departments, the shared sacrifices, and the mutual respect that has carried us through. Everyone contributed something invaluable - time, effort, support, or leadership - all to advance a collective vision bigger than ourselves.
              
              At this point, it's clear: we are no longer just a team. We are more than a group of like-minded individuals who set out with big dreams and high hopes.

              The Grand Planning (30/4/2025)<br>
              Following our recent success at the Regionals, today marked our first session back - and the atmosphere was electric. None of us had imagined making such a remarkable comeback. After early setbacks, we demonstrated what it truly means to Overcome and Adapt, pushing through high-pressure conditions that tested our team’s patience, resilience, and unity.

              But with Regionals behind us, it was time to set our sights on a new goal: Nationals. The challenge ahead demanded not just hard work, but strategic planning - planning that would showcase to everyone what it really means to be an Algoryphon.

              To begin, Mr. Miles led a reflective team discussion, reviewing both the obstacles we faced during the competition and the victories we achieved. Among the issues highlighted were malfunctions with the vertical slides - one becoming slower than the other due to damage - as well as loose wiring near the drivetrain, which temporarily prevented T.R.I.T.O.N. from navigating properly at the start of a match. Despite these challenges, Mr. Miles commended the team for our ability to resolve problems on the fly and finish the competition with a fully operational robot - an accomplishment in itself.

              With the reflection complete, the focus shifted to the future: How would we prepare for Nationals with less than two months to go?

              Mr. Miles created a mind map as we discussed ideas, ensuring we had a clear reference for the weeks ahead. Rupesh initiated the technical brainstorming by proposing hardware upgrades. One major idea was the integration of a colour sensor, which would allow the robot to autonomously identify and collect the correct specimens during matches. He also suggested designing a new intake mechanism - replacing the scoop with a claw-style intake, inspired by Team Python's successful design. Confident in the concept, Rupesh expressed his commitment to building the new system before Nationals.

              On the software side, Tom and Amber emphasised the urgent need to prioritise autonomous mode. At Regionals, we competed without an autonomous program and still qualified - highlighting just how much potential we could unlock by implementing one. They discussed the pros and cons of continuing with block-based programming or transitioning to Java, a decision to be finalised in upcoming sessions.

              Meanwhile, Josh W. and Harry introduced ideas for expanding our digital presence. They proposed launching official Algoryphon social media accounts and building a team website. The goal: to showcase our journey, connect with other teams, and reach wider audiences. Harry volunteered to develop the website, while Josh W. offered to manage an Instagram account, creating content and engaging with the broader FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) community.

              Finally, Rhys brought up the importance of updating our team portfolio to reflect our recent achievements and future plans. He also reminded everyone of the upcoming cake sale on May 15th, an important fundraising opportunity that would help support the proposed upgrades and outreach initiatives.

              With responsibilities now clearly divided, the team left the session feeling optimistic and determined. We had a bold plan, a clear vision, and a shared belief that we could not only succeed at Nationals - but also serve as role models to young, aspiring students who dream of exploring the world of robotics.
