        We are a team of enthusiastic Year 12 students from The Gryphon School in Sherborne, Dorset, proudly stepping into the world of robotics through our first year participating in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC).
        <br><br>
        Although this is our debut season, we are approaching the challenge with determination, curiosity, and a strong team spirit. As newcomers, we understand the steep learning curve ahead - but we’re not here to be underestimated. We’re ready to face every obstacle head-on, learn quickly, and compete with resilience and creativity as well as learning to Overcome and Adapt in the challenges ahead. 
        <br><br>
        For some of us, this may be our only season due to the academic demands of Year 13, but we are committed to making the most of every moment. We may not be here for a long time, but we’re here to make it count - and to have an unforgettable experience along the way. But that doesn't mean we can't support the new members that we bring along next season to take our place and to embrace the Algoryphon spirit. So without further ado, let the excitement and games commence!

        Through our journey in FIRST Tech Challenge, we’ve had the incredible opportunity to grow both individually and as a team. We've developed a wide range of technical and interpersonal skills, embraced leadership roles, and strengthened our ability to collaborate effectively. This experience has not only challenged us to push our limits but has also been immensely rewarding and enjoyable. We've built a team culture that values excellence, innovation, and - most importantly - fun!
