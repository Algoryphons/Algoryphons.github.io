          We are a team of enthusiastic Year 12 students from The Gryphon School in Sherborne, Dorset, proudly stepping into the world of robotics through our first year participating in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC).
          <br><br>
          Although this is our debut season, we are approaching the challenge with determination, curiosity, and a strong team spirit. As newcomers, we understand the steep learning curve ahead - but we’re not here to be underestimated. We’re ready to face every obstacle head-on, learn quickly, and compete with resilience and creativity as well as learning to Overcome and Adapt in the challenges ahead. 
          <br><br>
          For some of us, this may be our only season due to the academic demands of Year 13, but we are committed to making the most of every moment. We may not be here for a long time, but we’re here to make it count - and to have an unforgettable experience along the way. But that doesn't mean we can't support the new members that we bring along next season to take our place and to embrace the Algoryphon spirit. So without further ado, let the excitement and games commence!

            Welcome To FTC
          </div>
          The journey of The Algoryphons began with a spark of curiosity and a shared passion for innovation. At the time, none of us had heard of the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) - an international robotics competition that champions STEM education and collaborative problem-solving. When Mr. Miles, our dedicated computer science teacher, introduced us to the program, we were immediately inspired by the opportunity to engage in a global initiative that blends technology, creativity, and teamwork.
          
          <br><br>
          Recognising the potential of this challenge, we set out to form a team that could rise to the occasion. What started as a small group of computer science students quickly grew through word of mouth, as like-minded peers joined us, each bringing unique skills and perspectives. Together, we founded The Algoryphons - a name that reflects both our technical roots and our imaginative spirit.
          
          <br><br>
          From the outset, we knew this would be more than just a competition. It would be a journey of growth, resilience, and discovery. With a shared commitment to Overcome and Adapt to every challenge, we began laying the foundations of a team ready to take on the world of robotics in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC).
          


          <br><br>
          <div id="our_journey_txt_header">
            Initial Ideas
          </div>
          
          As the competition began, we quickly realised the importance of making our presence known - to show that a small rural school made up entirely of first-year students has the capability and determination to take on such a monumental challenge.
          
          <br><br>
          So, where did we begin?
          
          <br><br>
          Our journey started with an introduction to the competition by Mr Miles, whose enthusiasm for the event was infectious. His passion inspired us to fully commit to the challenge - striving not only to have fun but also to uphold the core values of gracious professionalism and cooperation. But before we could take our first steps, we needed an identity - a name that captured our team’s essence.
          
          <br><br>
          During our first official session, we brainstormed various potential names, including "The Sherbots" and "Enigma Sigmas." While creative, these didn’t quite capture who we were. Eventually, we landed on The Algoryphons - a fusion of “algorithm” and our school name, The Gryphon School. The name represents our technical aspirations and our origin. With that, The Algoryphons were founded - ready to Overcome and Adapt to any challenge, and eager to demonstrate our team spirit and enthusiasm throughout the competition.
          
          <br><br>
          However, a strong name alone wouldn't be enough. We needed leadership to provide direction, organise tasks, and ensure we stayed focused under pressure. An internal election was held, with three candidates - Harry, Xiang Yao, and Fynn - each bringing unique strengths and inspiring ideas to the table. After thoughtful interviews and team voting, Fynn was elected as team captain. His confidence and energy, paired with a clear plan for engaging team activities, made him the ideal leader to guide us through the season.
          
          <br><br>
          With leadership in place, the team divided into three focused departments, each with their own goals and responsibilities:
          
          <br>
          Engineering, led by Rupesh, whose prior hands-on experience and technical knowledge made him a natural choice.
          
          <br>
          Programming, led by Harry, whose resilience and depth of coding experience made him the best fit for the role.
          
          <br>
          Marketing, led by Rhys, who demonstrated strong leadership, creativity, and a passion for communication—crucial for building our public image.
          
          <br><br>
          With a strong foundation and clear leadership, The Algoryphons officially embarked on our FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) expedition.
          
          <br><br>
          Each department played a critical role in our development and success.

          <br>
          Week 1 (2/10/2024) [Summarised version from Initial Ideas] <br>
          During our first official session, Mr Miles introduced us to the competition with great enthusiasm, detailing everything about the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) and how beneficial it can be for us, inspiring us to approach the challenge with both energy and professionalism. We focused on establishing our team identity, brainstorming various names such as "The Sherbots" and "Enigma Sigmas." Ultimately, we chose The Algoryphons - a combination of “algorithm” and The Gryphon School - a name that reflects both our technical focus and our roots. This marked the beginning of our journey, united under a shared vision to Overcome and Adapt.

          <br><br>

          Week 2 (9/10/2024) [Summarised version from Initial Ideas]<br>
          While establishing a team identity was a crucial first step, effective leadership was essential to ensure coordination, task management, and sustained focus throughout the competition. In our second official session, we held an internal election with three strong candidates - Harry, Xiang Yao, and Fynn - each offering distinct skills and compelling visions for the team. Following a structured process of interviews and team-wide voting, Fynn was chosen as team captain. His confident leadership style, coupled with a clear strategy for fostering engagement and collaboration, positioned him well to lead the team through the challenges ahead.
