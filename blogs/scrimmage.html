              <h2>Off to the Scrimmage!</h2>
              
              <p>
                The Scrimmage Event, which was held at Bournemouth University Talbot Campus on the 11th December 2024, was attended by many robotics teams around the South West, including our team The Algoryphons. Our day was filled with many different talks from STEM-themed talks from representatives of RNLI lifeboats and Bournemouth University, while in the afternoon we had the chance to engage with different teams and exchange ideas and techniques to support our progress as a team.

                We gathered at the school gates by 7:15 ready to leave for Bournemouth University on our minibus, attended by our teacher overseers, Mr Martin and Mr Miles. Our photographer, Ryleigh was also there, who took multiple photos in order to document the event. As everybody was ready to leave we decided to bring along our robot to the competition, which proved to be a smart decision as almost every other robotics team brought along their robot too. In total, the drive to Bournemouth University was around an hour and ten minutes. When we arrived, we walked into a large community building and were ushered into a class full of other robotics teams. Here, we learned about different companies that worked alongside STEM. The first to speak was FIRST Global which included one of the teams that we would soon find ourselves to be competing against, UltraViolet. We heard about how they competed internationally and their journey through their robotics process. This gave us an insight over how the event was run and what we could expect going forward. Next to speak was the RNLI over how engineering can help save lives in the field. It was very interesting as we learnt how technology within lifeboats play a key role in keeping people safe on the coastline. After this, Gartner spoke on securing food systems. We heard about how technology can help us address sustainability solutions and our food supply. Afterwards, Bournemouth university was the last to take the stage. Firstly, they spoke about apprenticeships, such as their engineering apprenticeships which have opportunities to open up careers within STEM for young aspiring engineers. Lastly, they finished up the talk about how the afternoon will play our during our stay at Bournemouth University.

                When all the talks were finished, it was time to have lunch before we could carry on with our robotics experience. During this period, we were granted the opportunity to explore the Bournemouth University campus, giving us a feel for how learning would work if we were to study there. Soon after, we found ourselves in a seminar room full of other robotics teams where we watched the opening video for the Into The Deep, which told us about the rules and regulations for the game and how it was played, including a 30 second autonomous mode, where the robot moves about with no human supervision by going off of code made beforehand, and the submersible pit, a cluster of samples from bordered off by the ascension bars and specimen rungs. Soon after this we had the opportunity to meet other robotics teams and play test our robot. Due to some time restrictions, we were unable to drive our robot with only the main skeleton of the robot having been built before the Scrimmage, which meant that we could not practice. Nonetheless, we still talked with other teams about their robot and their design process and also learned about what a good performance should look like within the game. After about two hours of this, we filed back into a seminar room for Bournemouth University and Into The Deep to give a closing statement and send us home.

                Overall, this experience was very informative and inspiring for us as a team and shown us what goals we have to work towards as a team. This also helped us to figure out what we have to do to our robot in order to help us within the Into The Deep game. Thanks to this experience, the team was buzzing full of ideas that they were ready to discuss during the next session, with each department having their own plan for how the team can improve in every area.
