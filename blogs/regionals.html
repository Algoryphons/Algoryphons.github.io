              <h2>The Regionals: What Happened?</h2>
              <p>
                One of the many climaxes of our team journey at Algoryphons was the Regional event, which took place on the 25th of April, which again, was attended by main robotics teams across the South-West who also attended the Scrimmage event hosted earlier in the year. This time we got to put our robot to the test against other different teams and unique variations of robots. Our day was filled with preparation, weigh-ins, presentations, and of course, the competition and award ceremony.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                We arrived at the Gryphon School early in the morning, so as to make it to the competition on time, which took place at Bournemouth University in the same building that the Scrimmage event was held. As soon as our teachers, Mr. Martin and Mr. Miles, arrived we were ready to move on our way to the Regionals. This time around, we had new items that helped us stand out over other robotics teams, such as our new designed T- shirts displaying our name, logo and sponsor, and also brightly coloured banners showing our team. When we arrived to the university, we made our way to our pit table, where we quickly got everything prepared and ready to show greet other teams and expand our socials.
              </p>

              <p>
                At the very beginning of our day at the competition, we were required to do a presentation about our journey and robot and the trials and tribulations we faced throughout. Within this presentation, we had Fynn, our group leader talking and introducing our team, we had Rupesh explaining the work and dedication put into the robot, we had Harry on the programming side of the robot, we had Rhys displaying the unique design and marketing strategies, and we had Josh talking about the fundraising and Merchandise that the team have produced. Overall, this presentation was successful in proving to the judges how confident our team was and our hard work displayed throughout the sessions.
              </p>

              <p>
                After our presentation was completed, we headed to the arena to show that our robot passes through all of the rules required for our robot and this also succeeded, which was beneficial for our team's morale. Our robot had to go through many trials, such as weigh-ins and motor checks just to name a few. Here, we were able to see the competition line-up, which shown who we would be competing against throughout the day. During the matches that we were placed in, you would be facing two teams in an alliance, while your team had an alliance of your own. Within this, you would strategise with your alliance and figure out your strengths and weaknesses, including which area of gaining points your robot would be better at. Our robot was less advanced than other robots at this competition which meant that we could only handle specimens with our claw and slides. However, we pushed forward through these matches. Also, due to the lack of time, we were unfortunately unable to create an autonomous period for our robot, meaning that the first 30 seconds of the matches would be useless for our team.
              </p>

              <p>
                During these matches, our robot had some problems with the design and unlucky flaws with our technology. Our first problem was from the slides installed in the centre of the robot. These were made so that the robot could raise specimens onto the rungs, gaining us more points overall. However, while playtesting, we realised that the robots movement was not performing properly and in one match, even was unable to move. We quickly looked over the robot to identify what the root of the problem was and we discovered that the slides were too low down to the ground, which meant that the slides were stuck to the floor and, as a result, stopped the robot from moving properly. Between our matches we quickly Overcome and Adapted to this problem, allowing for a quick and easily mobile robot in the match arena.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another problem we faced through the matches was from the claw and slider controller. This controller was a sequence of buttons that allowed T.R.I.T.O.N. to score points within the match by picking up things with its claw and placing it on the rung. During one specific game, the controller was not working properly and as such, meant that we couldnâ€™t score points for the game. After investigation on the controller after the match had ended, we deduced that the controller had suffered irreversible damage to the controls. Fortunately, we were prepared with a spare controller which luckily worked properly and, again, we overcame the problem and continued in our other matches.
              </p>

              <p>
                One other problem we faced with our robot was from the programming of the sliders. Within our robot, we had two sliders which should move upwards at the same time when the controller is moved accordingly. Our problem was that the holding for the specimen located in the sliders was unstable and usually dropped the specimen from the basket. As soon as our match ended and discovered that we had a problem, we quickly worked to figure out what was causing the error in the robot. After some investigation, we found that the slide on the right was going upwards slower than the slide on the left. As a result of this, we coded our slide to make it so that it would move upwards at the same speed and time of the other slide. After solving this problem we took the robot back into the arena for another match. However, when we started playing, we saw that there was still a key problem with the slides. Immediately, we figured that the best plan of action for the robot was to remove the faulty slide leaving the left slide on its own to work perfectly, therefore, our team overcame the problem and adapted to the rough disaster that came our way.
              </p>

              <p>
                After these series of unfortunate events, the robot faced no other problems. However, because of these difficulties we still placed at the bottom of the Leaderboard at 14th place. This did not lower our morale, however, as we knew that this experience was beneficial for our team for learning how to overcome and adapt against all the problems we had faced along our journey. However, in a drastic turn of events, our social and sportsmanship skills turned to be in our favour when a leading alliance team turned to us to take part in the final knockouts of the qualifiers. Suddenly, a team from 14th place had moved into one of the top spots. Because of this, we were required to play in more matches to determine the winners of the qualifiers. Within these matches we played with confidence and grace and ended up in third place, a very proud moment for the team.

              <p>
                At the end of the day, the achievements were held, congratulating all the teams that made it this far. Within this, our team was awarded the runner up of inspire award which was a big achievement for us as a whole. Afterwards, the hosts of the event announced who will be moving on to the National Finals held in the London Copper Box Arena. Out of all the teams, there could only be five moving forward to the National Finals, including the winners of the event and the runner ups of the inspire award: our team. Hearing that we were going to London for the finals was a massive achievement, as this was our first year in taking part.
