              <h2>Eaton Workshop: Meeting With Representatives</h2>
              <p>
                On the 28th February , we welcomed representatives from Eaton to our school for a scheduled meeting to showcase our team’s ongoing progress and design concepts. This visit took place during one of our regular weekly sessions, with all team members actively engaged in their respective areas. The Eaton representatives had the opportunity to observe our work in real-time and see our robot in action, marking an important milestone in our project development.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the Design and Marketing department, our focus was on refining our portfolio and brainstorming effective ways to represent our dynamic team. We also explored various concepts for our team shirts, using our collaborative board on Figma as a source of inspiration. The Eaton representatives provided valuable feedback on how we could better highlight our team's identity and achievements, offering insightful suggestions to elevate both our portfolio and visual branding.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Engineering team was dedicated to constructing the Mecanum drivetrain - a critical component that would enhance our robot’s manoeuvrability and scoring potential in competition. Eaton’s expertise proved invaluable, as they offered practical advice that helped guide the construction process. This support contributed directly to the following week’s successful testing phase, during which we drove the robot across the school to evaluate performance.
              </p>

              <p>
                Within the Coding division, we were focused on programming the new Mecanum drivetrain to ensure smooth, responsive movement. Simultaneously, we reviewed the competition rulebook to identify scoring strategies and ensure compliance with all technical regulations. The Eaton representatives also lent their knowledge here, assisting our programmers in optimising the drivetrain control system for improved driver handling.
              </p>

              <p>
                In conclusion, this visit proved to be an incredibly productive and inspiring experience for our team. The insights and support provided by Eaton not only enhanced our current work but also energised us for future projects. The meeting sparked new ideas related to expanding our presence through initiatives such as a dedicated team website and merchandising efforts - steps that will help us grow both as a robotics team and as a community.
              </p>
