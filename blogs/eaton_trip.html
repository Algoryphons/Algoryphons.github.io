              <h2>Eaton Visit: To Mission Systems</h2>
              <p>
                On the 13th of May 2025, nine members of the Algoryphon Robotics team - Josh, Rhys, Harry, Amber, Adonis, Rupesh, Tom, Aaron, and Lukas - had the privilege of visiting Eaton Mission Systems in Wimborne. This insightful and inspiring experience offered us a closer look into Eaton’s operations, technologies, and the real-world applications of engineering in the aerospace industry.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our journey began at midday, departing from The Gryphon School in the school minivan. After an hour-long journey to the Eaton facility on the outskirts of Bournemouth, we were warmly welcomed by Eaton representatives Adam and Roy. Upon arrival, we were issued personalised lanyards and escorted to a designated meeting room, which served as our base for the day. To our surprise, each of us was gifted a branded Eaton water bottle - a thoughtful touch that underscored their professionalism and hospitality.
              </p>

              <p>
                We began with a round of introductions. Our team shared our progress and ambitions, detailing the evolution of our robot, T.R.I.T.O.N., and outlining our efforts in design, marketing, social media, and the development of our team website. This gave Eaton insight into our multifaceted team structure and collaborative workflow.
              </p>

              <p>
                In return, Eaton delivered an engaging presentation on their mission and expertise. We learned about the critical aerospace systems they manufacture - specifically, aerial refuelling pods. These systems enable mid-air refuelling for fighter jets via an extendable hose, which trails behind a tanker aircraft. As the hose deploys, the receiving jet aligns itself with the drogue to engage and transfer fuel mid-flight. This impressive technology enables longer missions without the need for aircraft to land and refuel, showcasing Eaton's vital role in military and commercial aviation.
              </p>

              <p>
                While some staff members prepared a flight simulator experience, we were given a guided tour of the facility. Through observation windows, we watched skilled technicians assembling the pods - an eye-opening experience that demonstrated the scale, complexity, and precision required in aerospace engineering. Seeing these components in real life, after learning about them conceptually, gave us a deeper appreciation for the field.
              </p>

              <p>
                Back in the meeting room, we had the opportunity to try the flight simulator, taking control of the refuelling aircraft in a realistic virtual scenario. This was both challenging and enjoyable, allowing us to understand the intricacies of aerial operations from a pilot’s perspective.
              </p>

              <p>
                The visit concluded with a final reflection on the day’s activities and a renewed sense of appreciation for the engineering profession. For many of us, this was a first glimpse into the real-world application of STEM careers, particularly within the aerospace and defence industries. It also shed light on potential career paths, including apprenticeships and industry placements.
              </p>

              <p>
                Overall, the Eaton visit was an unforgettable experience that not only strengthened our relationship with a key sponsor but also broadened our horizons as aspiring engineers, designers, and innovators. Eaton’s hospitality, professionalism, and commitment to inspiring the next generation were evident at every stage of our visit. We left with greater knowledge, a sense of purpose, and a deeper respect for the incredible work being done at Eaton Mission Systems.
              </p>
