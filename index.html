                As it is the team's rookie year we did not expect to qualify for the UK National Finals, but we did! 
                And you sure bet we made the most of it! 
                Although we did not come home with a trophy or award we did come home with a 3D Printer due to completing a competion. 
                To add to this success the team qualified 4th out of 32 teams within our division (Div 2 - Pacific) which meant we got to choose our alliance partners for the knockout rounds. 
                We can confidently say we had a great alliance partner with a great team chemistry as we allowed them to focus on specimines whilst we focused on scoring samples in the buckets. 
                This allowed us to get all the way to the quarter-finals of the whole competition (Semis of Division 2) where the team agonisingly lost 124-125. 
                However, we are all very proud of ourselves as a team, due to it being our rookie year in FTC we managed to get so far within the competition and redifine what being a team in FTC means!

          As a team, we recognize the importance of having a clear and purposeful mission to guide our outreach efforts within the local community. A defined mission not only provides direction but also amplifies our ability to share our identity and goals with those around us. Prior to our formation, STEM-related opportunities were virtually non-existent in our area. Through our participation in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), we’ve discovered a deep passion for STEM, and we are committed to sharing that enthusiasm with others.
        
          <br><br>
        
          Community outreach has become a cornerstone of our FTC journey. By engaging with our school and community events, we aim to raise awareness about STEM and inspire the next generation of innovators. These outreach efforts allow us to highlight the possibilities within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics - fields that are increasingly vital in today’s technology-driven world.

          We’ve made a name for ourself in our previous season, 
          but now it’s time to educate our community all about this experience. 
          To encourage young minds to find interest within STEM. 
          To improve our brand image, 
          embracing this season to the full as well as creating memorable moments within the team and our local community.

          In our rookie year as a team we certainly introduced ourselves on the national stage, we want to take that further, we want to be prominent and established name.
          We hope to push furhter and surf the high the team is currently on, to go deeper into the competion then we ever have before, which will be a humongous task.
