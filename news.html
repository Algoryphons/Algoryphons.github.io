                  Our Algoryphon Eaton trip was held on the 13th May 2025 at Eaton Mission Systems Wimborne. 
                  This was attended by 9 of our Algoryphon team members, including Josh, Rhys, Harry, Amber, Adonis, Rupesh, Tom, Aaron and Lukas. 
                  Throughout the day we were guided around by Eaton representatives around their facility and even got to work through a flight simulator based on refueling a jet midair.

                  One of the many climaxes of our team journey at Algoryphons was the Regional event, 
                  which took place on the 25th of April, which again,
                  was attended by main robotics teams across the South-West who also attended the Scrimmage event hosted earlier in the year. 
                  This time we got to put our robot to the test against other different teams and unique variations of robots. 
                  Our day was filled with preparation, weigh-ins, presentations, and of course, the competition and award ceremony.

                  On the 28th of February 2025, we scheduled a meeting with Eaton representatives at our school to show them our progress and design ideas. 
                  This event was a normal weekly meeting with all members of the team hard at work, 
                  while Eaton representatives came around to view our work that we were doing. This was also a great opportunity to show the Eaton members our robot working in action.

                  was attended by many robotics teams around the South West, including our team The Algoryphons. 
                  Our day was filled with many different talks from STEM-themed talks from representatives of RNLI lifeboats and Bournemouth University, 
                  while in the afternoon we had the chance to engage with different teams and exchange ideas and techniques to support our progress as a team.
